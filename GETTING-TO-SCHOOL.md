### GETTING TO SCHOOL

> I wake up at 6:30 am.
> Then I drink a cup of water.
> After that I go to the bathroom to brush my teeth and wash my face.
> I then proceed to get dressed and go down stairs.
> It's about 7 am now so I start to eat breakfast.
> I finish eating at about 7:30 am then my dad drives me to school.
> On the way to school I go through about 2 highways and a lot of traffic.
> I reach school at about 8:40 - 50 am.
> Then I usally go up the escalator to the 11th floor.
> I saw a text from my friend, Beauty that it our room is 1-2 for today.
> Normally I go in the other door but since today our room is 1-2, I went in the wrong room so I walked out and went in another door.
> I finally reach 11th floor room 1-2.
